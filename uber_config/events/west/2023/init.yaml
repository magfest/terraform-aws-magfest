            Many staffers want to work setup and teardown shifts rather than work during the event. We have 
            more volunteers than we need to do this, so we require DH approval of volunteers who need hotel

        full_description: >
            <div class="text-left">All attendee-facing rooms will automatically receive a 24"x36" coroplast sign for outside of the room. Please submit requests for <strong>additional</strong> signage here.
            <br/><br/>We will compare all requests against our known signage inventory, so please include your complete list of needs. (If you store any signs with your department supplies, however, we will not have records of them in our signage inventory, so DON'T include those here--this helps us avoid double-ordering.)
            <br/><br/>Signage comes in two types: 12"x18" coroplast and 24"x36" coroplast. Be sure to specify FOR EACH SIGN:
            <ul><li>Number needed</li>
            <li>Size of sign</li>
            <li>Primary text of sign</li>
            <li>Sub text of sign (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Intended placement location for sign</li>
            <li>Link to any custom artwork that is needed</li>
            <li>Any additional notes</li></ul>
            <br/>The signage department reserves the right to reduce or decline requests according to their discretion. We will contact you if significant changes to your order are necessary.
            <br/><br/>Note: This checklist item is NOT for printed materials such as sign-up forms, waivers, or anything else that goes on standard office paper. STOPS has a paper cutter and a printer for small jobs (less than 50 pages). Anything more than 50 pages needs to go into the Bulk Print Jobs checklist item.
